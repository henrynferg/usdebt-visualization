# Visualizing the U.S. National Debt  

If you stacked all the pennies it would take to pay off the national debt of the United States one on top of the other, how high would the resulting coin stack be? How about nickels, dimes, or quarters? This project uses P5.js (https://p5js.org/) and the U.S. Debt to the Penny dataset (https://www.transparency.treasury.gov/dataset/debt-to-the-penny) to create a graphical representation of the national debt on the scale of the Solar System.
